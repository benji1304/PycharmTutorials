# example of a loop

# for i in [2,4,5,6,7]:#using actual values
#     print("i = ",i)
#
# for i in range(10):#cycles through the range, from 0 for 10 values not to 10!
#     print("i = ", i)
#
#
# for i in range(2,10):#cycles through the range, from 2 for 10 values not to 10!
#     print("i = ", i)
#

# using modulus
# i = 2
# print((i%2==0))

# Use for loop to cycle list from 1 to 21
for i in range(1,22):
    if (i%2!=0):
        print(i)

# Use modulus to check for NOT equal to 0
